## Inheritence

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
where a new class (subclass or derived class)is created by inheriting attributes 
and behaviors from an existing class (base class or parent class). 
The subclass can add or override functionalities, promoting code reuse.

# Example

```
class Animal:
      def speak(self):
        print("Generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

# Creating an instance of Dog
my_dog = Dog()

# Inheriting and using the speak method from Animal
my_dog.speak()  # Output: Generic animal sound

```
